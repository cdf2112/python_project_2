    "# Analysis of Posts from Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Data Science project with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular website [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a nice source of information and fun. If you click the link to this site, you will see it is composed of a great many numbered posts by contributors on disparate technology topics. You can view comments (if any) for each post, and select special posts that begin with \"Ask HN:\" (ask Hacker News) and \"Show HN:\" (show Hacker News). It doesn't take long to learn to navigate through all these posts and find interesting topics and questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project we will analyze and otherwise have some fun with a data set taken from these posts on Hacker News. The data set samples a year of posts and a description of the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). One thing to note in the link is that time stamps in the posts are Eastern Time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python programming language and concepts at an intermediate level to accomplish our mission. Roughly put, our mission is to analyze poularity of posts made on Hacker News during different times of the day. We will focus on analysis of string objects, and time and date objects in what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's open up this data set we will use for the project, and look at the header and first four rows."
